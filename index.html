                <h2>Gardening</h2>
                <p>
                    Gardening is an activity that is quite physical. It includes weeding, plant watering, mulching, trellising, and harvesting–all of which involve the gardener's physical labor. It, therefore, becomes a great complement to your workout routine. Gardening is a very practical activity as well.
                    <br>
                    While many crops grow in the wild, in their homes or yards, individuals also grow and grow certain crops, bushes, and trees. This activity is referred to as gardening. Although it may seem to some as a hobby, the reality is that gardening is truly quite useful and therefore essential to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aesthetic gardening appeals to the need for beauty in human beings. Ornamental gardening is happy with beauty to our side. Furthermore, flowers are a component of most occasions like  <span class="text-primary">births, anniversaries, weddings, birthdays and funerals.</span> 
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Gardening is a good and enjoyable pastime. Each garden is surrounded by a fence. Usually, fences are made of wood or bamboo. The green fence is raised around the garden sometimes.</p>

                <h2>Dancing</h2>
                <p>Dance is my favourite hobby and I enjoy dancing a lot. I started dancing when I was five years old and when I got older; my parents enrolled me in dance classes to pursue this passion.
                <br>
                I cannot go a day without dance, that’s how much I love dancing. I tried many dance forms but discovered that I am most comfortable in Indian classical dance. Thus, I am learning Kathak from my dance teacher.</p>
                <p>I aspire to become a renowned Kathak dancer so that I can represent this classical dance internationally. Dancing makes me feel happy and relaxed, thus <span class="text-success">I love to dance.</span>  I always participate in dance competitions at my school and have even won a few.</p>
